Types of Control Flow in Python:
1.The if statement
2.The if-else statement
3.The nested-if statement
4.The if-elif-else ladder

1.if statement:(syntex)    
if condition:                                                                     
   statement1
statement2
# Here if the condition is true, if block  will consider only statement1 to be inside  its block.
1. IF STATEMENT EXAMPLE:
# Python program to show how if statements control loops  
  
n = 5  
for i in range(n):  
    if i < 2:  
        i += 1  
    if i > 2:  
        i -= 2  
    print(i)

2. EXAMPLE 2ND:
# Python program to show how to control the flow of loops with the break statement  
  
Details = [[19, 'Itika', 'Jaipur'], [16, 'Aman', 'Bihar']]  
for candidate in Details:  
    age = candidate[0]  
    if age <= 18:  
        break  
    print (f"{candidate[1]} of state {candidate[2]} is eligible to vote")  
3. EXAMPLE 3RD:
# Python program to show how to control the flow of a loop using a continue statement  
# Printing only the letters of the string  
for l in 'I am a coder':  
    if l == ' ':  
        continue  
    print ('Letter: ', l)  
4. EXAMPLE 4TH:
# Python program to show how to create empty code blocks using a pass statement  
for l in 'Python':  
    if l == 't':  
        pass  
    print('Letter: ', l)  
5.EXAMPLE 5TH:
# Simple Python Program to print the largest of the three numbers.  
a = int (input("Enter a: "));    
b = int (input("Enter b: "));    
c = int (input("Enter c: "));    
if a>b and a>c:    
# Here, we are checking the condition. If the condition is true, we will enter the block  
    print ("From the above three numbers given a is largest");    
if b>a and b>c:    
# Here, we are checking the condition. If the condition is true, we will enter the block  
    print ("From the above three numbers given b is largest");    
if c>a and c>b:    
# Here, we are checking the condition. If the condition is true, we will enter the block  
    print ("From the above three numbers given c is largest");  





2.if-else statement:(SYNTEX)
if (condition):
    # Executes this block if
    # condition is true
else:
    # Executes this block if
    # condition is false

EXAMPLE 1ST:
# Simple Python Program to check whether a person is eligible to vote or not.  
age = int (input("Enter your age: "))    
# Here, we are taking an integer num and taking input dynamically  
if age>=18:    
# Here, we are checking the condition. If the condition is true, we will enter the block  
    print("You are eligible to vote !!");    
else:    
    print("Sorry! you have to wait !!");


EXAMPLE 2ND:
# Simple Python Program to check whether a number is even or not.  
num = int(input("enter the number:"))         
# Here, we are taking an integer num and taking input dynamically  
if num%2 == 0:      
# Here, we are checking the condition. If the condition is true, we will enter the block  
    print("The Given number is an even number")    
else:    
    print("The Given Number is an odd number")
